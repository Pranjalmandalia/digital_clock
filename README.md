# Digital_clock
## Communication_Protocol = I2C 
In this project we use the RTC- Real Time Clock Module (DS1307) to get real time value which work on I2C protocol and for interfacing this we use the AVR Atmega32 microcontroller and we use seven segments display to display digits and use the Time multiplexing to reduce the complexity of Hardware.
